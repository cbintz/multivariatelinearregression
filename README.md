Homework 1 for Machine Learning (CS465): Multivariate Linear Regression using Gradient Descent
- Created in Octave/Matlab.
- Predicts a state's gas consumption based on local conditions. 
- Performs feature normalization, estimates theta using gradient descent, plots the cost curve, and computes theta using the normal equation.
